# Julia Floating-Point Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common subtle error in Julia related to floating-point number comparisons. The `myfunction` function, while appearing to correctly handle positive and negative inputs, fails to accurately handle comparisons involving floating-point numbers close to zero due to floating-point precision limitations.  The solution shows how to mitigate this issue.
